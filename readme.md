# cli-example

cli-example is a minimal, experimental CLI tool built with [Ink](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ink) (using React + TypeScript) that demonstrates how to create interactive terminal interfaces using modern web technologies. The motivation for this project was the recently released [claude-code](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@anthropic-ai/claude-code), Anthropic's agentic AI coding tool. After looking at the minified source code, I was curious how one would go about making a similar sort of tool.

## Features

- Modern Terminal UI: Built with Ink, leveraging Reactâ€™s component model for a clean and interactive experience.
- TypeScript-Powered: Enjoy type safety and autocompletion while building your CLI.
